# sws_tourist
Repository for storing code and associated files for the tourist consumption package.  This code computes an adjustment which should be applied to the food balance sheet in order to account for consumption of tourists.  This correction is small for most countries; however, countries with small populations and large tourist volume could be significantly impacted by tourism.

** All work under this repository represents the latest status of development and is made public for collaboration purposes. It does not reflect the current state of the system and use of the program is at the discretion of the users. **
